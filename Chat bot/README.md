# Chat Bot
## Problem Definition
To create a chatbot that interacts with the user and answers their queries. It helps to reduce the efforts of a person who should consistently watch for new messages from thousands or millions of customers and reply to them. The model uses **Encoder-Decoder LSTM Model** to generate response.

## How to Run
Download the repository and run 'Chatbot.ipynb'. It saves the model in output folder. This model can be later used for testing or deployment of the model.

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/eibriel/rdany-conversations<br>
This kaggle contains data of conversations of rdany bot with humans in telegram. This data can used for training the model.

## Objective
Our objective is to create a chatbot that replies to the human. It should generate new responses rather than using a certain predefined set of responses which helps customers feel more comfortable as chating with a other person.
