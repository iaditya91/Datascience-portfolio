# Datascience-portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks and python files.

## Contents:
### Machine Learning
* **Reinforcement Learning:** Training an agent to play mountaincar game: Creating an Q-Learning driving agent that will go to the destination with less back and front moves in mountain car game.
<br>

### Deep Learning
* **Self Driving Car using CNNs:** Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize steering angle the car needs to rotate using the camera placed infront of the car.
Tools: scikit-learn, Tensorflow
<br>

### Natural Language Processing
* **ChatBot:** Generative chatbot which generates the response messages on its own without relying on the predefined set of answers. Used Bi-directional LSTM sequence to sequence encoder-decoder architecture.

* **Music Generator:** Generates new music sequences in ABC notation. Used Char-RNN Archituture to train the music.

Tools: keras, scikit-learn

<br>

### Micro Projects

* **ML with Support Vector Machine Classifier:** Using SVM Classifier to predict Fraud Credit Card Transactions.
* **ML with K Nearest Neighbours:** Using KNN  model is used to predict the survival of the passengers in the Titanic ship, while choosing the best value for K using the elbow method.
* **ML with Navie Bayes Classifier:** Using Naive Bayes Classifier to classify messages to spam and no-spam.
* **ML with Hierarchical Clustering:** Using Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering approach to cluster the customers based on their Annual Income and Expenditure.
* **ML with K-means Clustering:** Using K-means Clustering create clusters the customers based on thier features Annual Expenditure and Spending scores.
* **ML with Decision Tree vs Random Forest Tree:** Using Decision Tree vs Random Forest Tree classifier to compare the accuracy of ML model in the use case of Kyphosis Disease Prediction.
